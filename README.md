# REI (RNA Expression Index)

REI has been the pilot project for AOE (All of gene Expression http://aoe.dbcls.jp/ ).

REI Project is to maintain an index for gene expression data in ArrayExpress, which is now the largest gene expression database in the world. 
ArrayExpress now regularly exports gene expression data in NCBI GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) after the curation of data.

`00script` directory contains the scripts to get metadata in the ArrayExpress ftp site.
